# IBD_treatment
Bulk RNA-Seq. The goal of the study was to investigate a new treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) using mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs). These cells exhibit immunomodulatory functions and are therefore potential candidates for cell transplantation therapy, which is one of the treatments for IBD.
